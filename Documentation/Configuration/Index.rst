Page TS-Config
--------------

You can configure your newsletter default via Page TSconfig.

.. _configuration_example:

Typical example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: typoscript

   mod.web_modules.cute_mailing {
      # default sender mail
      sender = newsletter@undkonsorten.com
      # default sender name
      sender_name = Undkonsorten
      # default reply to mail
      reply_to = newsletter@undkonsorten.com
      # default reply to name
      reply_to_name = Undkonsorten
      # we use a page type to render html code optimized for emails
      page_type_html = 10
      # and a page type to render text emails
      page_type_text = 11
      # list markers allowed to be replaced in the rendered page
      allowed_marker = firstName,lastName,registeraddresshash
      # return path, e.g. for bounce mails
      return_path = bounce@undkonsorten.com
      # If you dont need multi language support you can deactivate it
      hideLanguageSelection = 1
      # uid of the default language of created newsletter
      language = 1
      # Basic auth if your newsletter page needs auth
      # Basic auth user
      basic_auth_user =
      #Basic auth password
      basic_auth_password =
      listunsubscribe_enable = 1
      listunsubscribe_email = unsubscribe@example.com
      # uid for a default recipient list if needed
      default_recipient_list = 1
      # uid for a default test recipient list if needed
      default_test_recipient_list = 3
   }

.. tip::

   Configuration is written to the newsletter when it's created. Therefore it's
   necessary to set all needed values before creating a newsletter.
   If a newsletter is created already and page ts config changed afterwards,
   the values of configuration are still the old one in the existing newsletter.
   You must delete the newsletter and creating a new one to get the new values
   of the configuration.

Taskqueue
---------

The `taskqueue` extension must be configured to run regularly, best via Scheduler.

.. _configuration_scheduler_task:

Create a new Scheduler Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose "Execute Console Commands" in the field "Class" in Scheduler Task.
The type should be "recurring". Set the frequency you need.
After saving the new task you can select the "taskqueue:run-tasks" as the "Schedulable Command".
Set the limit for "how many task should be executed in one run" (equal to how many mails will be sent in one run)
and save the task.

Now you are prepared for sending Newsletters. Scheduler will start executing the
spooled Tasks in the "Task Queue".
